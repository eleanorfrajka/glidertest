"""Check the report-design files that are vendored byte-identical across packages.

ctdcast ``main`` is the source of truth for the shared report-design files
(the encoder, CSS generator, page-manifest model, design tokens, mplstyle, and
the masthead-nav template).  oceanarray and glidertest carry byte-identical
copies and re-vendor from here; they never edit their copies in place.

Usage
-----
Verify the local copies match the recorded hashes (what the test does)::

    venv/bin/python scripts/check_vendored.py

Compare the local copies against one or more sibling checkouts::

    venv/bin/python scripts/check_vendored.py ../ctdcast ../oceanarray

Regenerate ``VENDORED.txt`` after an intentional edit to a vendored file::

    venv/bin/python scripts/check_vendored.py --update

Exit code is 1 if any file drifts (local hash mismatch, or a sibling differs),
0 otherwise.  A sibling repo or file that is absent is reported and skipped, not
counted as a mismatch.
